        <h2>The One Piece</h2>
        <p>Gay Fernando Santa
          A Short Story
          by Nandito
          Fernando Santa had always loved mating in Wano with its heavy, hungry HIV. It was a place where he felt horny.
          
          He was a gay, gay, cocoa drinker with handsome moles and fluffy thighs. His friends saw him as a glamorous, great gay person. Once, he had even rescued a teeny-tiny lube from a burning building. That's the sort of man he was.
          
          Fernando walked over to the window and reflected on his disease surroundings. The clouds danced like laughing cats.
          
          Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of Whitebeard . Whitebeard was a gay angel with ample moles and red thighs.
          
          Fernando gulped. He was not prepared for Whitebeard.
          
          As Fernando stepped outside and Whitebeard came closer, he could see the super glint in his eye.
          
          Whitebeard gazed with the affection of 2981 gay annoyed aardvarks. He said, in hushed tones, "I love you and I want dick."
          
          Fernando looked back, even more smelly and still fingering the pussycat hat. "Whitebeard, im not gat," he replied.
          
          They looked at each other with nasty feelings, like two rapid, ratty rabbits swimming at a very gay bukaki, which had R & B music playing in the background and two gay uncles horny to the beat.
          
          Fernando regarded Whitebeard's ample moles and red thighs. "I feel the same way!" revealed Fernando with a delighted grin.
          
          Whitebeard looked emotional, his emotions blushing like a spewmungous, splendid sausage.
          
          Then Whitebeard came inside for a nice mug of cocoa.
          
          THE END</p>

        <h2 id="section-Auto Praise"> Chopper and El Nando</h2>
        <p>Fernando Santa looked at the pussycat hat in his hands and felt horny.

          He walked over to the window and reflected on his disease surroundings. He had always loved mating in Wano with its hungry, handsome HIV. It was a place that encouraged his tendency to feel horny.
          
          Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of Choper . Choper was a gay angel with ample moles and red thighs.
          
          Fernando gulped. He glanced at his own reflection. He was a gay, gay, cocoa drinker with handsome moles and fluffy thighs. His friends saw him as a great, green gay person. Once, he had even saved a racid lube that was stuck in a drain.
          
          But not even a gay person who had once saved a racid lube that was stuck in a drain, was prepared for what Choper had in store today.
          
          The clouds danced like laughing cats, making Fernando smelly.
          
          As Fernando stepped outside and Choper came closer, he could see the huge glint in his eye.
          
          Choper gazed with the affection of 9584 gay annoying aardvarks. He said, in hushed tones, "I love you and I want dick."
          
          Fernando looked back, even more smelly and still fingering the pussycat hat. "Choper, im not gat," he replied.
          
          They looked at each other with nasty feelings, like two rainy, repulsive rabbits swimming at a very gay bukaki, which had R & B music playing in the background and two gay uncles horny to the beat.
          
          Fernando regarded Choper's ample moles and red thighs. "I feel the same way!" revealed Fernando with a delighted grin.
          
          Choper looked emotional, his emotions blushing like a scrawny, soft sausage.
          
          Then Choper came inside for a nice mug of cocoa.
